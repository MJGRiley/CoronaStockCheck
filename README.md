# CoronaStockCheck

Description: 

The long lasting impact of the Feb. 2020 Stock Market crash is still visible in the US Stock Exchange.
Our goal is to allow users to compare the Q1 2020 All-Time-High of an individual stock to the current price to evaluate whether they should buy in or not.

User Story:

AS A Stock Market Participant or Speculator
I WANT to see current data of particular stocks when compared to their 2020 Q1 All Time High (Before the Coronavirus Crash)
SO THAT I can make a more informed decision on whether a particular stock is undervalued to guide my investment decisions. 


Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN some particular stock of interest
WHEN I type in its ticker in the input form and click submit
THEN I expect the app to display current data and 2020 Q1 data on that stock along with a chart to visualize it.
